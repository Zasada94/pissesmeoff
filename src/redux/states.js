Two quid for a tea bag, some hot water and milk and you still fuck it up? Get in the bin. I am the kind of person who will happily pay through the nose for a shit haircut and leave with tears pricking my eyes without uttering a single complaint – I’ll probably even leave a tip – but don’t you DARE try to make me drink shit tea or I’ll go all ‘let me speak to the manager’ on you.",

If I go out of an evening and I want to have a cocktail, I will, and if you don’t want to then don’t. Fine, glad we are agreed on that.",

I wonder why they think they need to drop their emotional baggage onto me even though I did nothing wrong.  Why must people bring me down when all I am being is myself?  They need to check themselves before they wreck themselves (and others people!). There is no justifiable reason to be rude to others, so why do people do it anyway?",
